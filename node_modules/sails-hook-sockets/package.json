You probably won't need to change anything unless you were extensively using the old Socket.io v0.9 configuration.\n\n\n## Running the tests\n\nFirst, clone this repo, cd into it, and install dependencies:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets.git\ncd sails-hook-sockets\nnpm install\n```\n\n#### Run them all\n\nTo run all the tests, start a local redis server on port 6380 and then run the tests using mocha:\n\n```sh\nredis-server --port 6380\nnpm test\n```\n\n\n#### Run only certain tests\n\nAlternatively, you can run a particular set of tests with:\n\n```sh\nnode ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha -g 'without session'\n```\n\n> (this may be useful if you don't want to wait for all the tests to run, or e.g. if you aren't able to install a redis server locally.  However please make sure all the tests pass before submitting a PR.)\n\n\n\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
